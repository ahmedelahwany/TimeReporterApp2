# Time Reporter APP for Jira made by TEAM FALCON

In Jira cloud there are very limited possibilities to track the invested time of a team on a project. We want to help team members and managers to be able to track and get insights into time usage. Our easy to use application helps organizations to successfully deliver projects.

## Installation

Use the package manager [npm](https://nodejs.org/en/) to install The TimeReporter app.
 Before opening the index.html file to run the site , please run these two commands in the app directory to install the packages required for the app and build the application . Then, everything is fine

```bash
npm install 
```
```bash
npm run build
```
